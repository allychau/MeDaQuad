POVERTY v COVID

In this report, we will explore Covid-19 and its relationship with poverty rates in America. I will first start by describing the dataset that I used to analyze the topic.

This dataset was downloaded from the United States Census Bureau's website.
I also merged data from the "United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State" from the Center for Disease Control website.

It contains poverty rates for all US states for 2016. The Data includes poverty totals and percentages from each state and county. 
I selected the columns to analyze, merged the COVID-19 data from the CDC and excluded the Poverty/ COVID-19 total for US. From this data I created a bar chart and scatter plot.

This bar chart highlights the distribution of homeless in the United States by state and the scatter plot looks at the correlation between COVID-19 and people in poverty. The data shows that there is a solid corrilation between poverty and instances of COVID-19. The data also shows that states with higher populations generally have greater levels of poverty.
