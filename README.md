POVERTY 

In this report, we will explore Covid-19 and its relationship with poverty rates in America. I will first start by describing the dataset that I used to analyze the topic.

This dataset was downloaded from the United States Census Bureau's website.
I also merged data from the "United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State" from the Center for Disease Control website.

It contains poverty rates for all US states for 2016. The Data includes poverty totals and percentages from each state and county.
